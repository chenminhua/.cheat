While pandas adopts many coding idioms from NumPy, the biggest difference is that pandas is designed for working with tabular or heterogeneous data. NumPy, by con‐ trast, is best suited for working with homogeneous numerical array data.

#### series
A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values (of similar types to NumPy types) and an associated array of data labels, called its index. The simplest Series is formed from only an array of data:

#### dataframe
A DataFrame represents a rectangular table of data and contains an ordered collec‐ tion of columns, each of which can be a different value type (numeric, string, boolean, etc.). The DataFrame has both a row and column index; it can be thought of as a dict of Series all sharing the same index. Under the hood, the data is stored as one or more two-dimensional blocks rather than a list, dict, or some other collection of one-dimensional arrays. The exact details of DataFrame’s internals are outside the scope of this book.
